# codingExerciseProject
The project revolves around teaching code to people.
Each "teacher" can create a room where students can enter and learn how to code with an assignment.
the teacher and students can see the amount of active students in a room every single moment,
each letter or line that updates in the code editor is updated for every member in the room and if the students complete the assignment
a message pop's to congratulate them.
If the teacher closes the room all students are kicked out.
